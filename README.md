# TRISTE (a really sad Tetris clone)

This project was realized (in a very small amount of time) during the 3rd year Bachelor course of "Programmazione di Interfacce" (Graphic User Interface Programming) at the University of Pisa a.y. 2018/2019.

You can play the game [here](https://triste-service.onrender.com).

## How to play

The goal of the game is to draw as many polygons as possible in the given time. The more polygons you draw, the more points you get. The game is over when the time is up or when your pieces leave the playing area. Be careful, the smaller the pieces are, the fewer points you get!

## Libraries

The game is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The game engine is [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/), a 2D physics engine for the web.
